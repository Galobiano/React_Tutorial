// Update Function in React is a special function that lets you change the value of something inside your component, like the background color or a counter. When you change that value, React automatically updates the screen to show the new value.

// ex. setYear(arrow function )
// safe update 

// Asynchronous functions in React help keep the UI responsive and improve the user experience, as they allow other code to run while waiting for time-consuming tasks (like data fetching) to finish.
